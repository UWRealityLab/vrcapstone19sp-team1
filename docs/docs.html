          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
              Tom Furness mentioned one of the greatest applications of VR/AR is in the education or training space. Most of the successful applications to this date have been in this space. One of the greatest challenges for students is math. Within the field of math, one of the greatest challenges as the student progresses in level of math is understanding abstract concepts like higher dimensionality. To help understand these concepts we will introduce EasyMath. It will provide a number of features to enable students in the elementary to middle school age ranges study math better. Our hope is for students that learn visually better understand math, specially geometry.
          </p>
          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>
              Francisco is a student at Boston Middle School. Today, in math class, he was assigned his first ever 3D geometry homework. At night, when Francisco started working on the homework he realized that Problem 1, where he needed to create a sphere and explain how changing the intercept and the variables in the equations will change the size, view, etc. of the sphere. He felt very lost and confused because he wasnâ€™t able to visualize this sphere. To his rescue, EasyMath, the first of its kind online 3D geometry interactive simulator, allowed Francisco to enter his sphere equation on the website, see it plotted on his Magic Leap device, and see how changing the intercept and variables affected the shape of the sphere!
        </p>
        <p>
              Here is how the set up will look like: Francisco will be on his computer and have his Magic Leap headset on. He would be working on the math problem on his computer. To see the object from his Magic Leap headset, he will select a place for the object to appear, say next to his computer. At times when he is confused with some equation, say the equation for a sphere, he can enter the equation into a web application to see the graph displayed in 3D. This will allow Francisco to observe the graph to gain more insights.

          </p>
          <h3>Hardware Platform/Device</h3>
          <p>
              We will use the Magic Leap because it will enable the student to see the real world (their homework or textbook) at the same time as getting assistance through the EasyMath features. A very big stretch goal of ours will be to also have this functionality on a phone as well through ARCore on an Android Phone.
